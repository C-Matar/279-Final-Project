# CHEM279 Final Project

I created a data folder to hold the ANI-1 files. Here is the download link: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/ANI-1_data_set_20M_DFT_energies_for_non-equilibrium_small_molecules/5287732?backTo=%2Fcollections%2FANI-1_A_data_set_of_20M_off-equilibrium_DFT_calculations_for_organic_molecules%2F3846712&file=9057631

The tar file can be extracted in the data folder.

You can place the convert.py script in the data folder. The convert.py file just needs the filename and output name to be altered depending on which .h5 file you are interested in creating a .csv file for.
